name: pre-commit
# This workflow runs pre-commit checks on all files and handles formatting-specific branches
# The pattern matching logic uses bash string pattern matching instead of regex
# for more consistent behavior across different environments (local vs GitHub Actions)
# Added direct branch name matching for known formatting fix branches
# Updated to use both string pattern matching and regex for better keyword detection
# Fixed issue with generic "branch" keyword causing false positives in branch name matching
# Added branch name normalization to handle invisible characters and encoding differences
# Implemented array-based branch matching for better maintainability and reliability
# Improved handling of invisible characters in branch names

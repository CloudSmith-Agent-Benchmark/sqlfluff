echo "The issue is caused by invisible characters (like zero-width space, ASCII 8203) at the beginning of the branch name."
echo "These characters are not visible in normal text display but affect string comparisons in bash."
echo "The fix uses 'tr -cd [:print:]' to remove non-printable characters from the branch name before comparison."
echo "This ensures that the branch name pattern matching works correctly even if there are invisible characters."
